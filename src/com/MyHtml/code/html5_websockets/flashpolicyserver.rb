# # Flash policy server.

# # on port 843. 
# 
# # You must have root to start the service at port 843.
# # Windows users shouldn't be restricted by this.

# # windows:  ruby flashpolicyserver.rb
# # everyone else:  sudo ruby flashpolicyserver.rb
# 
# # This server is *not* recommended for production use.
